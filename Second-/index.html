                  Iron Man is a fictional superhero who wears a suit of armor. His alter ego is Tony Stark.
                  He was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Larry Lieber for Marvel Comics in Tales of Suspense #39 
                  in the year 1963 and appears in their comic books. He is also one of the main protagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br>
                  Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism. 
                  Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time.
